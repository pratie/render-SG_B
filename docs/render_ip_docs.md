In my Rails app I’ve been using GitHub - rack/rack-attack: Rack middleware for blocking & throttling to block abusive requests for years (on Heroku) with much success. I’d also been using IPCat GitHub - kickstarter/ipcat-ruby: Ruby port of client9/ipcat along with rack-attack to automatically block requests from datacenters.

When I switched over to Render I had to fork IPCat and remove all of CloudFlare’s IPs from its IP list because Render using CloudFlare and all traffic to my site was getting blocked by IPCat. It’s working fine again after removing the CloudFlare IPs.

Perhaps you could do something similar within your app’s stack.

I believe fail2ban only works for log files and scanning those.

I am going to investigate ipcat a little more- that looks like it might work for our purposes.

Cloudflare will only block IP’s if Render requests it on your account, since we don’t work with cloudflare independently so we don’t have our own cloudflare dashboard.

Static Outbound IP Addresses
Render services send outbound traffic through a specific set of static IP addresses. You can use these addresses to connect your service to IP-restricted environments outside of Render.

To obtain a service's static outbound IP addresses:

Open the Render Dashboard.
Click a service to open its details page.
Open the Connect dropdown in the upper right.
Switch to the Outbound tab and copy the list of IP addresses:
List of static IP addresses in the Render Dashboard

Legacy Oregon services
If a service in the Oregon region belongs to a workspace that was created before January 23, 2022, that service does not have access to static IP addresses.

You can enable static IP addresses for these legacy Oregon services in one of the following ways:

Configure a static IP provider like QuotaGuard.
Create a new workspace, then create new services to replace the legacy services. Migrate over any data, domains, and configuration.

How to block specific IP address - Facing Bot Attack - NodeJs WebService

We are facing a bot attack on our NodeJs Webservice. There is a specific IP address that keeps making a request and Cloud Instance usage keeps increasing. Please help/suggest a solution.

We are using CloudFlare CDN, which takes care of root domain bot attacks. But Custom domain requests are reaching the render instance directly. That’s why we are facing an issue.

Is there any bot detection service or IP block feature is there in Render.com?

Hi Raja,

We’ll address your specific case in your open support ticket.

In general, services hosted on Render have some automatic protections against various attacks. Typically, if you need extremely fine-grained control, the best approach today would be to add a proxy you manage in front of your render service.

I’d also encourage you to take a look at https://feedback.render.com/features/p/web-application-firewall and give it an upvote if it’s something you’d be interested in. It helps to include as much context as possible about your use case, the problem you’re looking to solve, and how you’re getting around it today to help us develop the best possible solution.

We rely heavily on customer feedback as a part of our planning and product roadmap process, so capturing interest on the feature request page is very helpful.

Regards,

Matt

IP ranges to use for whitelisting
Apr 2021

We have a couple of services running on render that need to access a database that is hosted on Google Cloud SQL. For production, we’d like to button up the incoming connections that this DB can accept, and limit it to a whitelist of IP blocks.

Can you provide IP ranges that render services can be hosted on that we can use for this purpose?


Unfortunately, we don’t have a static set of IP address for allowlists. Other users have used Quotaguard to achieve this.

IP Whitelisting

Hi Brian,

Since the requests are proxied, I don’t think you would be able to key off of the request IP. Can you instead try using the X-Forwarded-For request header?

Best,

Thanks Jade!

This worked out pretty well. Your suggestion led me to some ExpressJS documentation about using that header. Ultimately all I had to do was add one line of code, which told ExpressJS to read the IP from that header instead.

app.set('trust proxy', true);
Here’s the documentation page for anyone else running into this scenario:
